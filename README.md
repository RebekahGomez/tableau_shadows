# What We Do In The Shadows

### Description

- The original dataset was a collection of all the horror movies on IMDb from 2012-2017. I focused on one outlier in the dataset, What We Do In The Shadows (2014) which turned out to be a modern cult classic, as well as a financial success.
- I supplemented the dataset with my own research. Number of Ratings and Worldwide Box Office numbers for each film were missing from the dataset, so I collected that independently.
- Several of the films also had a Budget associated with them, but not all of the budgets were in USD, so I added a conversion to my supplementary data to compare movies budgets' in the same currency.
